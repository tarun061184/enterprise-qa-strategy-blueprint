# Defect Metrics and Quality Measurement Model

## Objective
Provide quantitative visibility into product quality and defect trends.

## Key Metrics

### Defect Density
Number of defects per module or release.

### Defect Leakage
Defects found in production compared to pre-release defects.

### Defect Removal Efficiency (DRE)
DRE = Defects removed before release / Total defects identified

### Mean Time to Resolution
Average time taken to fix defects.

### Automation Effectiveness
Automation detected defects / Total defects detected

## Quality Reporting

- Weekly defect trend reports
- Release quality scorecards
- Root cause analysis dashboards

## Continuous Improvement

- Analyze recurring defect patterns
- Improve test coverage
- Enhance automation effectiveness
